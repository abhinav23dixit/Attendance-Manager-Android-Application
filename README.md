# Attendance-Manager-Android-Application
This application helps you maintain your attendance status of all subjects. You can create any number of subjects and
track their attendance at any time. Most importantly, you can schedule a notification at any desired time to know the
subjects in which your attendance is short and attend your classes accordingly. The application uses SQLite Database to
deal with subjectâ€™s information and its attendance.
